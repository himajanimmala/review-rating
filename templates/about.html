<h2 style="text-align: center"> About the Review - Ratings </h2>

<h4 class="navbar navbar-light" style="background-color: #e3f2fd;"> Review - Ratings </h4>
<p> There are times when a user writes Good, Nice App or any other positive text, in the review and gives 1-star rating, here the semantics of review text does not match rating.
    To fill-up this gap, built this application to identify such ratings where review text is good, but rating is negative- so that the support team can point this to users.
    In this data app - the user will upload a csv and hit Process, it will display the <b>reviews where the content doesnâ€™t match ratings</b> as result.</p>
